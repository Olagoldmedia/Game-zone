Great follow-up, bro! The navbar (navigation bar) is one of the most important parts of a professional multi-page website — it helps users jump between sections easily. Since you're working with pure HTML and CSS, your navbar content should be consistent across all pages, with links to your main sections.

🔗 Professional Navbar Content (Text Only – for All Pages)

Here's what should be inside your navbar — the same across all your pages (Homepage, About, Downloads, Reviews, Ratings, etc.):

📌 Navbar Menu Items (Left to Right):

🏠 Home – index.html

🧾 Reviews – reviews.html

📥 Downloads – downloads.html

🌟 Ratings – ratings.html

📰 Updates – news.html

📜 About – about.html

📫 Contact – contact.html

🔐 Optional Navbar Items (If you want login/signup):

👤 Login – login.html

📝 Register – register.html

📋 Suggested Navbar Text (Example Format)

[ GameZone ] | Home | Reviews | Downloads | Ratings | Updates | About | Contact | Login 

You can use icons like 🎮, ⭐, 📰, etc. for a more modern touch (with images or emojis), or stick to plain text for a cleaner look.

✅ Bonus Tips:

Highlight current page – For example, when you're on the "Reviews" page, make the "Reviews" link bold or a different color.

Mobile version idea – If you later upgrade, you can convert the navbar into a responsive hamburger menu using just CSS.

Would you like me to write a navbar structure example in plain text (how it should look on the page), or explain how to make it look more like a gaming site (dark theme, neon accents, etc.) using CSS ideas?
